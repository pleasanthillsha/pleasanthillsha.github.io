## Credit Reporting Notice

This Credit Reporting notice is to inform you of an exciting new net-zero cost technology your board has activated. The United States Congress has passed an Act allowing association assessment credit reporting for communities nationwide. We believe this will prove to be the gold standard in financial management for the community association industry as it has been for decades in the mortgage, credit card, and auto loan industries.

Pleasant Hills Homeowners Association is, each month, reporting on-time and late payment statuses for assessments and special assessments for all homeowners within our association to consumer credit agencies. Only delinquent owners will be charged for reporting. 

Reporting is starting in January 2023 and it will be reported each month going forward. No previous payment history from the prior months will be reported until it is also past due this year (past due balances still need to be repaid with late fees, however, their reporting to the credit bureaus will not occur until considered late with the 2022 annual dues). This credit reporting is an added value the association can provide to homeowners as on-time payments will be rewarded with positive points on an owner’s credit score each month, which in turn may lower the rates for new credit such as a mortgage, credit card, and auto loans. Any account delinquent 30 days or more will have a negative impact. 

Reporting assessment payment history to a consumer credit agency will help elevate the importance of the assessment to the same priority level of mortgages, auto loans, and credit card payments. The goal is to empower our community association with a payment reporting tool that will help the association better manage and protect its financial health and the property values of the homes in our community. 

**Homeowners who do not make their payments on time can avoid having information reported by entering into a Payment Plan. Payment Plans must be arranged with the Secretary-Treasurer. To submit a request for a Payment Plan, please contact the Pleasant Hills Homeowners Association Secretary-Treasurer by email at <contact@phha.info> or <paymentplan@phha.info>.**

If you have any questions about this technology, please contact your Secretary-Treasurer at <treasurer@phha.info>. If you have a credit report related inquiry or would like to dispute something that is reported on your credit report in the future, please call 888-851-5210.

**Please note that Pleasant Hills Homeowners Association does not collect any personal information (Social Security, Credit Card, or Driver’s License numbers) to report to the credit agencies, the bureaus already have all of the necessary information based upon property records.
