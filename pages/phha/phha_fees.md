## Payment / Correspondence Address

Dues and fees may be mailed to:
```
Pleasant Hills Homeowners Association
PO Box 5244
Pleasant Gap, PA 16823-5244
```

## Annual Dues / Association Dues

Annual dues of $85.00 are payable on January 1st each year and due on or before March 31st.

## Late Fee

In the event that a resident does not pay their dues on-time, a late fee of $10 per month for the first three months overdue will be assessed to the account. Residents are notified when a late fee has been assessed.

## Credit Reporting Fee

In the event that a resident does not pay on-time, the association will engage the services of a credit reporting agency (Sperlonga) to report their delinquency to the credit reporting bureaus. The fee of $25 per monthly reporting instance, as permitted by the Fair Credit Reporting Act, will be passed on to the resident and become part of the total amount due.

## Resale Certification Fee

When a resident is engaging in the sale of their home, a resale certificate is ordinarily required to certify that all association dues and fees are known and current. While residents will have the ability to see this information through receipts and, soon, the website, only a resale certificate will officially validate this information. At this time, a resale certification costs $25 and should be coordinated by contacting <resalecertificate@phha.info>

## Convenience Fee

In the event that a resident wishes to pay electronically, there is a convenience fee that is added to the usual fee(s) that the resident/realtor is paying. Under normal circumstances, this is in the amount of 2.9% + $0.30 of the original fees. Individual convenience fees may vary slightly depending upon market conditions in the payment transaction industry. This convenience fee is not collected by PHHA, instead, it is collected as part of the payment through our payment processor, Stripe.

## Covenant Violation Fees/Penalties

As all resident covenants have expired, there are no fees or penalties for violating any covenants.

## Transfer Fee

There are no transfer fees, however, at the time of transfer, a resale certification is usually required. Please see Resale Certification Fee above.

## Capitalization Fee / Capital Improvement Fee

At this time, our association does not charge a capitalization or capital improvement fee.

## Other Fees

At this time, there are no other fees.
