                YES! We are more than willing to work with homeowners who are having difficulties paying their annual dues. The most important part is that we see progress and commitment to resolving the dues which are necessary to maintain our neighborhood’s common areas. Please contact us via email to discuss the matter with our board.

                <strong>NO.</strong> The Pleasant Hills Homeowners Association exists to maintain common land and amenities. Our association does not have restrictive covenants that dictate how a homeowner may use, modify, or decorate their property. This includes items such as whether post lights are lit, where cars are parked, whether fences may be built, length of grass and/or weeds, or care for the shade trees. Clearly, we hope that all homeowners are respectful of their neighbors by ensuring that nuisances are eliminated with haste. However, most of these items are regulated by Spring Township ordinances. If you plan to make changes to your property, it is advisable to contact the Spring Township Code Enforcement Officer to discuss the changes and ensure that you will not be in violation of any ordinances (and that you get all the permits you need). If your neighbor is doing something that you disagree with, please peacefully discuss it with them. If you cannot resolve the issue amicably, the code or law enforcement officer is probably your next best bet.

                In an effort to encourage homeowners to pay their dues on-time, we are now reporting account status to the major credit bureaus. If your account is in good standing (with a payment plan or your account is not late) then your account will be reported as being in “good standing.” In the event that the annual payment due date of March 31st passes and you have not paid, your account will be noted as “Late” to the credit bureaus. This carries an additional monthly credit reporting fee of $25 in addition to the late fee of $10.

                Yes. Your deed carries a legal obligation to pay the annual dues as set by the bylaws of the Pleasant Hills Homeowners Association. If you do not pay your dues, your dues will remain payable, fees will continue to accumulate and the disposition/sale of your property will require that your dues and fees be paid prior to your property being transferred. In other words, your property cannot be sold until your dues are paid.

                <strong>Probably not.</strong> The Pleasant Hills Homeowners Association governing council will only represent the members of the association in matters that impact the common land areas, not individual properties. We encourage all residents to be active participants in their local government. Visit the <a href="https://www.springtownship.org/board-meetings?field_wp_bme_type_tid=20&undefined=Apply">Spring Township Meeting Information page</a> for information about their regular meetings.

                Residents are reminded not to sweep/blow/wash leaves into the street. Doing so stresses the basins and increases our cost in maintaining them. If you aren't able to place your leaves in the street right-of-way during the leaf collection time in the fall you should gather them to dispose with your trash hauler or in the <a href="https://www.springtownship.org/waste-collection">township landfill</a>.

                The Pleasant Hills Homeowners Association does not maintain any rules/covenants against cutting down these trees. However, these trees are considered shade trees and would be regulated by the <a href="https://ecode360.com/30966108?highlight=tree,trees&searchId=10396629396505574">Spring Township Shade Tree ordinance</a>.

                There are several public areas that the homeowners association tends to, accounting for over ten (10) acres of common land. The land is spread between the Pleasant View Park on Sandra Lane, the southern park lands across the retention basins south of the railroad tracks, the Patricia Lane gazeebo, and a sliver of land on Tamara Circle. These are maintained through contracted work with a local landscaper. There are, however, two slivers of land on Danielle that are what are legally referred to as "Paper Streets". Paper Streets belong to the original landowner and are to be maintained by them. In the image below, the green sections are maintained by the homeowners association. The purple sections are the paper streets that are to be maintained by the original landowner of the development.<br />
