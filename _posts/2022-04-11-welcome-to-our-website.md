Welcome to the new website for the Pleasant Hills Homeowners Association (PHHA). PHHA is located in Pleasant Gap, a village of Spring Township in Centre County in Pennsylvania. It is our hope that this website serves to provide nearly any piece of information that you may wish to know about our association, our beautiful community. 

Take a look around and, if you have a question for which you can't find an answer, don't hesitate to drop us a line at <contact@phha.info>
