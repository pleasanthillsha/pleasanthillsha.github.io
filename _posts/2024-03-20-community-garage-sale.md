## Annual Community Garage Sale

ðŸ—£ ðŸ—£ ðŸ—£ ðŸ—£ ðŸ—£ ðŸ—£  
We're looking for some feedback on Garage Sale Date Preferences. We typically have held our community garage sale the week of Memorial Day weekend as that is when Steeplechase has held their community garage sale weekend. We're looking for feedback on this as a few people have indicated that they would participate if we held it on a different weekend (as they are traveling over Memorial Day weekend). What do you think? Send us an email to let us know! [contact@phha.info](mailto:contact@phha.info)
ðŸ—£ ðŸ—£ ðŸ—£ ðŸ—£ ðŸ—£ ðŸ—£  

A - May 17-19  
B - May 24-26 (Memorial Day Weekend)  
C - May 31-June 2

## Personal Security Codes

You may have noticed the shiny silver sticker on the front-side of your green reminder cards. These stickers are scratch off stickers that hide your Personal Security Code. Your Personal Security Code is a code that can be used to uniquely identify you for communication with the board.

## Annual Budget Mailer - Coming Soon

The annual budget mailer is coming soon. As soon as we have the garage sale date nailed down, your secretary will be generating the newsletter and his annual letter to each of you.

## Annual Dues Payable!

Your annual dues are payable each year on January 1st and due on or before March 31st. Based upon the requirements set forth in the deed for your property, your dues need to be sent to your board sometime after January 1st and on or before March 31st. To clarify,
 - payable means that they are ready to be paid
 - due means the last day that they are due

Dues may be mailed to the [Payment Address](/phha_fees.html#payment--correspondence-address).
