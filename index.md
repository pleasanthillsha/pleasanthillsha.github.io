## Welcome!

I, along with the other members of the Pleasant Hills Homeowners Association Board of Governors, would like to welcome you to our new website. This website is the work of many members of the Board of Governors (both current and from previous boards) that gathered and attempted to make information available in different documents that had been passed along from one board to the next. That information is being compiled here for the current board and our community to use to make our community the very best it can be!

Thank you for visiting. I hope you find what you need here. If you don't, please contact us via the feedback links.

With warm regards,

Andrew Gearhart  
  Secretary-Treasurer,  
  Pleasant Hills Homeowners Association

## Regular Operations - What we do

A community with properly maintained community areas has been shown in numerous studies to increase property values. We see this in our community with rising property values and very rapid turnaround between listing and first offers (<30 days to sell compared to 90 days for 16823). Plus, simply put, having a well-maintained community increases the sense of pride that each of us have in the development in which we live. In the normal operations of the Pleasant Hills Homeowners Association, we are the stewards of over 10 acres of community land maintained for the benefit of our community. In addition to hazard insurance for these properties, we also coordinate the regular maintenance of the common properties with mowing, snow removal, equipment repair and replacement, and beautification projects.
